#### Virtual Environment (Recommended)

<summary><strong>ðŸš€ A better way to set up repositories </strong></summary>

A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. Using a virtual environment for your project ensures that the project's dependencies are isolated from the system-wide Python and other Python projects. This is especially useful when working on multiple projects with differing dependencies, as it prevents potential conflicts between packages and allows for easy management of requirements.

1.  **To set up and use a virtual environment for CrawlAI:**
    First, install the virtualenv package using pip. This tool helps create isolated Python environments.

    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

2.  **Create virtual environment**
    Next, create a new virtual environment in the project directory. This environment is a directory containing a complete Python environment (interpreter and other necessary files).

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate virtual environment**
    To activate the environment, run the following command: \* For windows:
    `bash
        source ./venv/Scripts/activate
        `

        * For Linux / MacOS:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```

    </details>

#### Install dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements.txt file contains a list of packages necessary to run CrawlAI. Installing them in an activated virtual environment ensures they are available to the project without affecting other Python projects or system settings.




python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
